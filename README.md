### Welcome to my profile! :rocket:

Enthusiast of technology and how it can cause a great impact in the world.
I'm a fullstack JavaScript and TypeScript developer, specialist interested in ReactJS, Node.js, React Native and all the ecosystem around it. I had worked with IT support for 7 years, so I have the experience to understand user's needs.
I want to make some difference on people's lives with development.
