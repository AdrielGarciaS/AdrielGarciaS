### Welcome to my profile! :rocket:

I have 10+ years of experience in IT, and since 2019, I have been working as a frontend specialist in software development, using ReactJS and Node.js. My goal is to make amazing products and ensure that users have a great experience. I am a technology geek and love to learn new things. I enjoy working in teams and always share what I learn.
